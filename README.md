# LAK Manager

``A Local Access Key Manager for windows desktop applications``

## Overview

The LAK Manager is a lightweight application that manages access keys for windows. It provides the capabilities to create and remove keys and provides basic encryption for the storage and distribution of these keys. Using the LAK API, you can implement functionality for LAK Keys into your desktop application. (LAK API is still in development. There, currently, is no production version)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **LAK API**
	- In development

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) Version 18.0.1.1:**
	- [Download for Windows x64](https://download.oracle.com/java/18/archive/jdk-18.0.1.1_windows-x64_bin.zip)

- **Apache Maven Version: 3.x or later:**
	- [Download Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Installation

To run this application, follow these steps:

Sure, let's integrate the original part into the instructions:


1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zjack8/lak-manager
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd lak-manager
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven by running the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. Once the build is successful, locate the generated EXE file in the target directory. Place it in a folder with JDK 18.0.1.1.

## App Limitations

While I've put in my best effort to create a functional and useful application, I want to be transparent about its current limitations. Some aspects of the app may not meet professional standards, and I acknowledge that there might be room for improvement. These limitations stem from my continuous learning journey as a developer.

### Challenges Faced:

1. Lack of Experience

As a relatively new developer, I am still in the process of honing my skills. This project has been a valuable learning experience, and I've worked hard to overcome challenges. However, it's important to note that certain features or optimizations might not reflect the expertise of a seasoned developer.

### What's Next?

I am committed to enhancing the LAK Manager and addressing its limitations over time. Your feedback is highly valued, and I encourage you to contribute ideas or report issues through the issue tracker. By working together, we can make this app better with each iteration.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
